# Intelligent-Movie-Recommendation-System
a unique movie recommendation model that uses variables gathered from user data, such as ratings, to suggest a list of movies that the user prefers. Several collaborative filtering approaches are utilized for the suggestion, resulting in a broad list of top movies that the user may or may not enjoy. Our method may be used to add user aspects, which are currently absent in existing collaborative movie recommendation systems
